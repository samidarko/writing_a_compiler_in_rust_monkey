# Monkey Interpreter in Rust

A complete interpreter for the Monkey programming language, implemented in Rust. This project is a Rust adaptation of the interpreter described in "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball.

## Project Background

I recently wrapped up *Writing an Interpreter in Go*, a book that demystified lexer, parser, ASTs, and evaluator logic. To deepen my understanding and sharpen my skills in Rust, I reimplemented the interpreter in Rust‚Äîand I couldn't be more satisfied with the outcome.

After over a decade in software engineering‚Äîsplit between systems infrastructure and full-stack development‚ÄîI realized that, despite my experience across multiple paradigms and languages, I never truly understood the mechanics behind interpreters. This project filled that gap, layer by layer.

Here's what I learned:

- The interpreter is built on clear, sequential stages‚Äîlexing raw text, parsing into syntax trees, and evaluating with the right semantics.
- Working through the Monkey interpreter in Rust taught me how these pieces fit together in practice‚Äîand how Rust's features impact implementation choices.
- It wasn't just about the code‚Äîit was about learning how languages work under the hood.

This project reminded me how rewarding it is to rediscover fundamentals‚Äîeven after years in tech. It's been one of my most fulfilling learning experiences in a while.

## Features

The Monkey interpreter supports:

- **Variables** with `let` statements and **mutable assignment** (`variable = new_value`)
- **Data types**: integers, booleans, strings, arrays, and hash maps
- **Type casting**: `int()` and `string()` builtin functions for type conversion
- **Operators**: arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`), logical (`&&`, `||`), and unary (`!`, `-`)
- **Functions** with closures and first-class support
- **Conditionals** (`if`/`else` expressions)
- **Built-in functions**: `len`, `first`, `last`, `rest`, `push`, `puts`, `exit`, `int`, `string`
- **Array indexing** and hash map access
- **Comments**: single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`)
- **String escape sequences**: `\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\\`, `\r`
- **Enhanced error reporting** with line/column position tracking
- **Enhanced REPL** with command history, special commands, and improved user experience

## Architecture

The interpreter follows a traditional compiler architecture:

1. **Lexer** (`src/lexer/mod.rs`): Tokenizes input text into tokens
2. **Parser** (`src/parser/mod.rs`): Recursive descent parser with Pratt parsing for expressions
3. **AST** (`src/ast/mod.rs`): Abstract Syntax Tree representation
4. **Evaluator** (`src/evaluator/mod.rs`): Tree-walking interpreter that evaluates AST nodes
5. **Object System** (`src/object/mod.rs`): Runtime value representation with environment scoping
6. **REPL** (`src/repl/mod.rs`): Interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
# Install from crates.io (when published)
cargo install monkey-interpreter-rs

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/samidarko/monkey-interpreter-rs
cd monkey-interpreter-rs
cargo build --release
```

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the enhanced interactive REPL
cargo run

# Run a Monkey program file
cargo run -- examples/fibonacci.monkey

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

### Example Monkey Code

```monkey
// Variables with mutable assignment
let x = 5;
x = x + 10;  // x is now 15

// Type casting with new builtin functions
let num_str = "42";
let num = int(num_str);    // Convert string to integer
let result = string(num);  // Convert back to string

// Variables and functions
let fibonacci = fn(x) {
  if (x == 0) {
    0
  } else {
    if (x == 1) {
      1
    } else {
      fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2);
    }
  }
};

fibonacci(10);

// Arrays and higher-order functions  
let map = fn(arr, f) {
  let iter = fn(arr, accumulated) {
    if (len(arr) == 0) {
      accumulated
    } else {
      iter(rest(arr), push(accumulated, f(first(arr))));
    }
  };
  iter(arr, []);
};

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let double = fn(x) { x * 2; };
map(a, double); // [2, 4, 6, 8]

/* Multi-line comments 
   are also supported */
let person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30};
person["name"]; // "Alice"

// Enhanced comparison and logical operators
let adult = person["age"] >= 18 && person["name"] != "";
if (adult) {
    puts("Person is an adult named: " + person["name"]);
}

// String with escape sequences
puts("Hello\nWorld!\tTab\tSeparated\"Quote\"");

// Exit the REPL
exit(); // or exit(42) for custom exit code
```

## Built-in Functions
